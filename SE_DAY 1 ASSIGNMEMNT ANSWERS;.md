1, The Birth of Structured Programming. 2, The Advent of Object Oriented Programming. 3, The Rise of Agile Methodologies.


1.Planning:This involves identifying the project scope, objectives and resources, it also includes risk assessment and defining project goals. 2.Testing: This phase involves identifying and fixing bugs and aslo verifying that the software b ehaves as expected ensuring the functions are correct and meet the requirements, 3.Design: This creates a blueprint for the software that outlines how the system interface will be built, this phase translates the requirements into a detailed plan for the software structure,  4.Requirements Analysis: This documents what the software needs to do, this phase gathers requirements from users, stakeholders, clients to determine the performance,functionality and constraints of the software.  5.Implementation(Coding): This phase involves writing the code using appropriate Programming, this is where developers build the software by translating design into code, 6.Deployment:immediately testing is complete and the software is stable, it is then deployed to the product environment where users can access it, 7.Maintenance: After deployement,the software may require bug fixes, new features and updates.This phase involves continuous monitoring and improving the software over time, 8.Review and Evaluation : This involves assessing the project to learn lessons and improve future development. this may be included as part of maintaince phase.


Waterfall and agile are 2 distinct software development methodologies, each with its own disadvantages and advantages. Here is a quick comparison: The waterfall model is linear approach where each phase of development must be completed before moving on to the next and it has disadvantages such as late testing which can lead to discovering issues at a stage where they are more expensive to fix, client involvement which can lead to dissatisfaction if the final product does not meet expectations, last is inflexible because if requirements change,it's hard to go back to a previous phase. Waterfall also has advantages such as clear structure which has clear goals for each phase, making the process easy to manage especially for complex projects, and documentation which ensure that knowledge is preserved and can be referred to throughout the project. Example of a scenario where waterfall is appropriate is regulatory driven projects which is ideal for projects where the requirements are well understood and unlikely to change like healthcare, manufacturing and defense industries, eg developing software for a medical device, where requirements dictate a strict and clear linear development process, would be suitable for waterfall. Agile methodology breaks down the development into small chunks called iterations oe sprints allowing for continuous feedback and development with disadvantages such as less predictability, can lack documentation and requires strong team collaboration while it's advantages are Flexibility and adaptability, Continuous feedback and Early detection issues. Example of a scenario where agile is appropriate is startups and product development which is ideal for projects where requirements are likely to change frequently such as seen in tech companies developing new products like a mobile app where features might evolve based on the user feedback and market trends which is good fo agile. in conclusion water is best suited for projects with well defined and stable requirements while Agile is good for progects that require frequent changes and flexibility. Choosing between the 2 depends on the projects needs and environment where the software is being developed.


1. Software Developer is responsible for coding, designing and implementing software applications,they work on various aspects of the software development lifecycle. Responsibilities are Problem solving, Testing, Documentation, Coding, System design and Continuous learning.  Task of a software developer is writing automated texts to validate code functionality and developing a new feature for an application,    2. A Quality assurance Engineer ensures that the software meets the quality stantards and requirements as before it is released. Respensibilities is continuously improving testing process and methodologies, collarborate with developers to understand application functionality and ensure it meeets the  requirements, 3. Project Manager coordinate and oversee the software development project from start to finish. They also ensure that the projects meets its goals and deadline, Responsibilities are ensuring project deliverables meet quality standards and are made on time, they also define project scope, objectives in collaboration with stakeholders.


IDEs and VCS are critical in modern software development processes. They improve collaboration and streamline coding to ensure the integrity of the codebase, they also significantly enhance productivity and code quality making them essential for teams and individual developers. 1. IDEs are software applications that provide develpoers with tools to test,write and debug code within a single imterface. Importance are Increased Productivity, Error Detection, Project Management and ease of testing, And examples of integrated development environments are Pycharm, Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA.         2. VCS on the other hand are tools that help developers manage changes to the codebase over time. They allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and they also track modifications provide mechanisms for resolving conflicts. Importance are; Branching and Merging, History Tracking, Collaboration and lastly Backup and Recovery. VCS examples are Mercurial, Git, Subeversion (SVN).

 
 Software engineers face a variety of challenges throughout their careers. Here are some common challenges with strategies to overcome them: 1, Debugging and Troubleshooting' the challange here in identifying and fixing bugs can be frustrating and takes time, to strategize here you can use systematic debugging approaches like binary search and breakpoints to isolate the issue. 2, Time Management and Meeting Deadlines; Can be a challange because balancing mutiple tasks and meeting projects deadlines can be stressful. To strategize here you have to prioritize which means using techniques like the Eisenhower matrix to focus on tasks based on urgency and improtance, you can aslo set achievable goals and communicate openly with stake holders about potential delays and progress. 3, Dealing with Complexity; This challange in software projects can become complex with growing codebases, making it quite hard to manage and understand.To strategize you need modular design which can breakndown large projects into smaller mangeable modules, also Refactoring which regulates refactor code to simplify and improve its structure. 4, Security Concern; This can be a huge challenge because ensuring that software is secure against attacks is a significant responsibility. Strategies are to stay updated on security pratices and regularly review and apply best security implementations to your codes,there is also Security Testing where you can continously educate yourself on the latest security threats and how to navigate them. 5,Managing  Technical Debt; Accumulating technical debt taken in code that needs to be addressed later  can slow down development and lead to big problems which can be challanging, To strategize you must conduct regular code reviews to identify techical debt early, you also balance short and long term goals which weigh the trade offs between fixes and long term sability.


 1. Unit Testing; This involves testing individual modules of a software application in isolation. The main goal is to verify that each units functions correctly on its own, it also helps fix bugs early in the development process. Importance are Early bug detection and code quality, 2. Integration Testing; this focuses on testing the interaction between differents modules or components of the software. The goal is to ensure that these modules work together as expected. importance are System cohesion, Early dectection of integration issues and Interface validation, 3. System Testing; This one involves testing the complete and integrated software system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. The goal is to validate that the entire system functions correctly and meets both functional and non functional requirements. Importance are System level issue Detection and End to End Validation with Readiness for Deployment, 5. Acceptance Testing; This testing is often performed by the end users or customers , it's also conducted to determine whether the software meets the business requirements of same end users, The goal is to validate that the software provides the expected value to the user and satisfies the acceptance criteria. Its importance are to ensure Customer Satisfaction and Minimizes Deployment Risks and also ensure that the software aligns wwith busines goals and user needs. By performing these tests at different at different stages of dvelopment, software teams can ensure that the software meets user expectations, catch and fix problems early and devliver a high quality end product.


Part 2 ; Intro to Ai and Prompt Engineering.


Prompt engineering is the process of designing and crafting prompts or input that effectively guide AI models like ChatGPT to produce desired outputs. Since AI models generate responses based on the text input they receive, the quality,structure and clarity of the prompt significantly influence the relevance and accuracy of the model's output. Importance of prompt engineering with Ai models are: 1. Efficency which minimizes the need for multiple iterations or follow up queries, a well structured prompt can generate the desired output in a single attempt saving time, 2. Customization where users can tailor the AI's responses to fit different contexts and style making interactions more personalized and suitable for various applications, 3. Mitigating Bias that can help mitigate biases in AI responses by farming questions in a neutral or balanced way. This is very important in sensitive contexts, 4. Unlocking Potential and this one helps unlocks the model's potential buy guiding it to perform complex tasks, from creative writing to technical problem solving that aligns with user end goals, 5. Error Reduction which anticipate misunderstandings and includes clarifying details in the prompt, users can reduce errors in AI's output this way.In summary Prompt engineering bridges the gap between humans intent and machine output, enabling more precise and meaningful use of AI tech.


Vague Prompts are unclear because they lack context, direction and specificity making it really difficult for the Ai to provide a focused and relevant response, example of a vague prompt is " What should i do " and example of an Improved point " What are some effective time management strategies for balancing work and personal life? " and this is why the improved prompt is better; 1. Clarity which clearly defines the context and time management so the AI knowns exactly what kind of advice is needed, 2. Specificity which narrows down the focus to strategies for balancing work and personal life ensuring a relevant response, 3. Conciseness: while the prompt is specific, it's still consis and to the point making it easy for the AI to generate a useful answer. This prompt guides the AI to provide actionable and targeted advice, making interaction extremely valuable and improved prompt more effective.
